## A couple of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix so that the cost of
## repetitive computation can be avoided

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
